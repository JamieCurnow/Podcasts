## What's This All About? ü§î

Podcasts is an open-source podcast app with a design that pays homage to the late, great Google Podcasts. It's built with a slick, modern stack: **Nuxt 3**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vite**.

This is a passion project in progress. The mission is to create a simple, beautiful, and easy-to-use podcast app that's completely **free of ads and tracking**. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### ‚ú® The Philosophy

- **No Accounts, No Problem:** No need to sign up or log in. Just pure, unadulterated podcasting.
- **Back to Basics:** Add your favorite podcasts the old-school way‚Äîby pasting in the RSS feed URL. It's a beautiful ode to the open web, and feels pure.
- **PWA for the Win:** Who needs an app store? This is a Progressive Web App (PWA). Add it to your home screen on iOS or Android, and it'll feel just like a native app. Long live the web!
